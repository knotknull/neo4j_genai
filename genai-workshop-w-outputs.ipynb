    "# Neo4j Generative AI Workshop\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neo4j-product-examples/genai-workshop/blob/main/genai-workshop.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will teach you how to use Neo4j for Graph-Powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) to enhance GenAI and improve response quality for real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "GenAI, despite its potential, faces challenges like hallucination and lack of domain knowledge. GraphRAG addresses these issues by combining vector search with knowledge graphs and data science techniques. This integration helps improve context, semantic understanding, and personalization, making Large Language Models (LLMs) more effective for critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We walk through an example that uses real-world customer and product data from a fashion, style, and beauty retailer. We show how you can use a knowledge graph to ground an LLM, enabling it to build tailored marketing content personalized to each customer based on their interests and shared purchase histories. We use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to accomplish this,  specifically leveraging not just vector search but also graph pattern matching and graph machine learning to provide more relevant personalized results to customers. We call this graph-powered RAG approach “GraphRAG” for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through the process, including:\n",
    "- Vector search\n",
    "- Using graph patterns in Cypher to improve semantic search with context\n",
    "- Further augmenting semantic search with knowledge graph inference & ML\n",
    "- Building the LLM chain and demo app for generating content\n",

    "- If you are participating in a Neo4j instructor-led training, you will be provided credentials to your own environment with pre-loaded data\n",
    "- If you are running this notebook independently, you can load a [database dump](https://storage.googleapis.com/gds-training-materials/Version8_Jan2024/neo4j_genai_hnm.dump) in your own environment or on Neo4j Desktop, or load the data using the companion notebook [data-load.ipynb](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/genai-workshop/blob/main/data-load.ipynb)\n"
